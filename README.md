# Diabetes Prediction Pubplic API

This project provides a Diabetes Prediction Model using machine learning, which predicts
whether a person has diabetes based on input features such as age, BMI, glucose levels,
etc. The model is deployed as a public API using FastAPI and hosted on Heroku for easy access.

## Features

Predict diabetes: The model predicts whether an individual has diabetes based on features like:

- Pregnancies

- Glucose

- Blood Pressure

- Skin Thickness

- Insulin

- BMI

- Diabetes Pedigree Function

- Age

- Public API: The model is exposed as a public API, which can be accessed via HTTP POST requests.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up and running the API, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x

- FastAPI

- Uvicorn

- Pickle (for loading the saved model)

- Heroku (for deployment)
